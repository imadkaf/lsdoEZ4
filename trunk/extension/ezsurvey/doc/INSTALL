NOTE: You will require eZ Publish 4.0 or higher

Information on the installation of eZ Publish can be found at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/installation


Installing eZ Survey extension
==============================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your
   eZ Publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary is depends on
   the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezsurvey-extension-2.0-beta2.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezsurvey-extension-2.0-beta2.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezsurvey-extension-2.0-beta2.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ Publish. To do this edit
   site.ini.append(.php) in the folder root_of_ezpublish/settings/override. If this
   file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add) the block
   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezsurvey

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the
   sites should use the extension, make the changes in the override file of
   that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezsurvey

4. Run the php script from commandline:
 
   $ php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php --extension

   Which is need to build an array of classes that are used by the autoload system 
   in PHP to load classes. You will need eZ Components availlable to run this script.

Initializing database
=====================

1. Manual install
   --------------

   o  Initialize schema

     The schema must now be created with all the tables, sequences and
     triggers for eZ Publish. Then the schema must be filled with data.
     Here you have two choices:

     You can start by insert the schema for the extension and then filling it
     with the basic data. You may skip the first to steps, if you already have
     a working eZ Publish installation working.

     o  Create the schema for eZ Publish
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
            share/db_schema.dba <dbname>

     o  Insert data for eZ Publish
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
            --schema-file=share/db_schema.dba \
            --insert-types=data \
            share/db_data.dba <dbname>

     o  Create the schema for eZ Survey. The SQL schema for the
        extension is located in ezsurvey/sql/<database-implimentation>/schema.sql 
        and can be done with for example:
  
        mysql -u<username> -p <dbname> <  ezsurvey/sql/mysql/schema.sql 

Configuration
=============

   o  Configuring eZ Survey

     To be able to use eZ Survey, you need to add new content classes in the
     administration interface. The neccessary classes is one for the survey and
     another class for the survey attribute. Follow the links to:

     And create the new classes.

     eZ Survey need one content class to define how the "Related object"
     question attribute in the survey should be. This is a normal
     contentobject which will be created when you are in the edit view of the
     survey class. You'll get back to the survey edit view when you've
     published the new survey attribute object. The other object is the the
     content class of the survey itself. You need to add a survey attribute
     datatype to this content class.

     You may choose to add the content classes with the "Manual installation"
     or select the included package with "Add content classes from a package".
     
     Manual installation
     -------------------

     Setup -> Classes -> Content


     o  Survey attribute class

       Is the content class which will be used as related objects when you
       create a new survey contentobject. The class need to contain one
       xml block attribute and one Text field attribute. The "XML block"
       attribute will be used in views for web pages and the "Text block" will
       be used as the text sent in Emails from the survey.

     o  Survey class

       Will be used as the new survey object which you can use to make a new
       survey in the content structure. The class could preferred contain a
       Text entry attribute and a survey attribute. Set the "Object name
       pattern" to the identifier of the Text entry.


    Add contentclasses from a package
    ---------------------------------
     
     You may add the two content classes from the included package. This can be
     done in the administration interface from the url:

     Setup -> Packages -> Import new package

     After importing the package, you will have the two classes as described in
     the "Manual installation" installed.


    Configuration of the "Related object" survey attribute
    ------------------------------------------------------ 

     o  Add a new content folder for the Survey attribute objects. 
   
       When a new "related object" attribute is created in a survey object, the
       related object need to be stored in a parent folder by the survey
       datatype. Create a new object (of class folder) where the related survey
       object should be stored.

     o  Configuration of the survey module

       Follow the links in the upper tab to:

       Survey -> Related object configuration

       The "Content class" should be set to the contentclass created above:
       "Survey attribute class".

       Set the parent folder for the survey attributes to be the same as
       described in the prevoius point.      
  

     o  Create a new survey

       Create a new object, for example in "Content structure". Select Survey
       and select the language and create the survey.
